<h1>Welcome to My Portfolio!</h1>
<p>I do not look at this portfolio site much. My apologies =). I find that by being a father of a 2 1/2 year old and working every day on the computer (currently for The Home Depot SSC,) the last thing that I want to do is fiddle with even MORE HTML and CSS and talk about me.
<em>That's what my <a href="http://www.facebook.com/will.bowling" title="My Facebook Account" target="_blank">my facebook.com/will.bowling</a> account is for, right?</em></p>
<p>As the days progress I will try to add new content and projects and sites that I find helpful. At any rate, check back soon and thanks for stopping by!</p>

<h3>Progressive Enhancement</h3>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement" target="_blank">Wikipedia Definition</a> - <em>"Progressive enhancement is a strategy for web design that emphasizes accessibility, semantic HTML markup, and external stylesheet and scripting technologies. Progressive enhancement uses web technologies in a layered fashion that allows everyone to access the basic content and functionality of a web page, using any browser or Internet connection, while also providing those with better bandwidth, more advanced browser software or more experience an enhanced version of the page."</em> </p>
<p>THIS is where my heart is, this is what I do. <a href="http://easy-readers.net/" title="Adaptive Web Design" target="_blank">find out more...</a></p>
<!-- <h3>How to GROK Web Standards</h3>
<p>Many times in my recent quests to find stable employment <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">in Florida</span>, I find mostly companies that are looking for Flash designers, programmers, or just plain web designers. It is hard for me to put myself in one of those categories. It reminds me of an article by Craig Cook Called <a href="http://alistapart.com/articles/grokwebstandards" title="How to Grok Web Standards">How to Grok Web Standards</a>. According to his article, to effectively design Web Standards compliant websites, you have to think like a writer, an engineer &amp; an artist.</p>
<p>My Newest Designs exist within this site. This portfolio will help to show my passion of designing/developing with <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> as well as <acronym title="Short for Hypertext Pre-processor">PHP</acronym>. My ultimate goal when developing is to provide the Client with a highly accessable, low bandwidth website with smaller file sizes and clean code.</p> -->

<h3>Tables? Why Tables?</h3>
<p>Ever since I taught myself HTML circa 1994, I have been using tables. Untill NOW! I personally came to the understanding, with the help of a GREAT <a href="http://aarronwalter.com/" title="Aaron Walter">teacher</a>, that by using CSS to <i>position</i> divs/boxes in the browser window, leaving as much text as possible for the search engines to discover and <i>ridding</i> embedded tables all together, one can achieve a <i>Table-Less</i> design! </p>
<p>This proves VERY important for forwards compatibility. Lets just say that you have a 300 page website that consists of sliced images and endless tables. Lets say that you decide you want to alter the appearance of the paragraph spacing and the fonts throughout the entire site. It would take forever! With Cascading Style Sheets and proper semantics, one could easily change these things with a few lines of code.</p>

<h3>Designing with CSS and Why</h3>
<p>DOMs and CSS support have come a long way since the beginning of the "Browser Wars." The W3C, WaSP, and major browser creators have endured tireless effort allowing future web designers the freedom of CSS support throughout most new browsers.</p>
<p>This Portfolio will reflect the Growing use of CSS within my work. I want to join the ranks of those before me; Spreading the news of the benefits and forth-comings of using CSS in web design.</p>
