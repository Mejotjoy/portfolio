			In a previous life, the internet was designed for one thing - text and information ONLY. Over the years, it has morphed into websites consisting entirely of tables, flash, images and very MINIMAL text. This will cause search engines to overlook your information.
		</p>
		<p>
			What I want is to bring it back to the basics, keep the design separate from the information. This is possible through table-less designs. This is a discussed more in depth in <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/dwws/" target="_blank">Jeffrey Zeldman's</a> book "Designing With Web Standards."

			My Newest Designs exist within this site. This portfolio will help to show my passion of designing/developing with <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> as well as <acronym title="Short for Hypertext Pre-processor">PHP</acronym>. My ultimate goal when developing is to provide the Client with a highly accessable, low bandwidth website with smaller file sizes and clean code.
