  <h3> Need a website in a Hurry?<br> 
		Need a bandwith solution for your existing Site?</h3>
    <p> My ultimate passion exists within these pages.
My main goal is to provide the Client with a highly accessable, low bandwidth website.</p>

<p>This site may be viewed on anything including CELLPHONES and PDA's. The visually impaired will be able to view/hear this site with a SCREEN-READER.</p>

<h3>Designing with CSS and Why</h3>

<p>DOMs and CSS support have come a long way since the beginning of the "Browser Wars."</p>

<p>The W3C, WaSP, and major browser creators have endured tireless effort allowing future web designers the freedom of CSS support throughout most new browsers.</p>

<p>This Portfolio will reflect the Growing use of CSS within my work. I want to join the ranks of those before me; Spreading the news of the benifits and forthcomings of using CSS in web design.</p>
