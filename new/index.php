  <h3>Web Design :: <br />Developed using <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym></h3>
    

<p>
In a previous life, the internet was designed for one thing - text and information ONLY. Over the years, it has morphed into websites consisting entirely of tables, flash, images and very MINIMAL text. This will cause search engines to overlook your information.</p>

<p>
What I want is to bring it back to the basics, keep the design separate from the information. This is possible through table-less designs.
This is a discussed more in depth in <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/dwws/" target="_blank">Jeffrey Zeldman's</a> book "Designing With Web Standards."</p>

<p>This site may be viewed on anything including CELLPHONES and PDA's. The visually impaired will be able to view/hear this site with a SCREEN-READER.</p>

<p> My Newest Designs exist within this site. This portfolio will help to show my passion of designing/developing with <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> as well as <acronym title="Short for Hypertext Pre-processor">PHP</acronym>.
My ultimate goal when developing is to provide the Client with a highly accessable, low bandwidth website with smaller file sizes and clean code.

<h3>Enjoy!</h3>

<!-- <h3>Tables are the WORST!</h3>
<p>Ever since I tought myself HTML in '94, I have been using tables. Untill NOW! I discovered that by using CSS to <i>position</i> divs/boxes in the browser window, leaving as much text as possible for the search engines to discover and <i>ridding</i> embedded tables all together, one can acheive a <i>Table-Less</i> design! </p> -->

<!-- <h3>Designing with CSS and Why</h3>

<p>DOMs and CSS support have come a long way since the beginning of the "Browser Wars."</p>

<p>The W3C, WaSP, and major browser creators have endured tireless effort allowing future web designers the freedom of CSS support throughout most new browsers.</p>

<p>This Portfolio will reflect the Growing use of CSS within my work. I want to join the ranks of those before me; Spreading the news of the benifits and forthcomings of using CSS in web design.</p> -->
